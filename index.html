                    <p>Research has shown that learning music boosts development in many other subjects. As children and teens build healthy practice habits, they gain discipline, patience, and confidence. Playing an instrument activates the whole brain, improves memory, and nurtures strong critical thinking skills.</p>

                    <p>Christopher Carson began his musical studies at the age of 6. By the age of 10, he was featured on PBS, performing Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu. Originally from Houston, Texas, he attended The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) and studied with Timothy Hester, a Juilliard graduate.

                    <p>Carson has been a very successful competitor, capturing many awards and top ratings in competitions throughout his career. He was the inaugural winner of the Pacifica Quartet Competition and, in 2009, performed the Brahms Piano Quintet with the Grammy-award winning group. He has received first prize in numerous concerto competitions and has appeared as a soloist with many orchestras over the years, most notably with Orchesterakademie in Germany in 2008, performing the Shostakovich Piano Concerto.
